A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

Regular Expression (aka Regex) is one of the most important and common in any programming languages. Of course, this also applies to Python. Python has some quite unique regex usage patterns compared to other programming languages.

1. Always use “r-string”
A lot of learners know that we should use “r-string” when we define a regex pattern. However, I found that many people don’t know the reason. Some learners think of the “r-string” as “regex string”, which is totally wrong. It should be “raw string” instead.
Just like other programming languages, Python has the “escape” mechanism in the strings. For example, when we want to have a string with quotes, they have to be escaped to let the compiler knows that the string should not finish, the quotes are just part of the string.

2. Use re.IGNORECASE Flag When Necessary
The “flags” is kind of unique in Python Regex which not all the other programming languages would have. That is, create regex patterns that are case-insensitive.

3. Use re.VERBOSE Flag to Improve the Readability
One of the major drawbacks of the regex is that it has poor readability. Usually, this is the comprising that we have to face. However, do you know that Python has a better way to improve the readability of a regex pattern string? That is to use the re.VERBOSE flag.
We can re-write the regex pattern in section 1. Originally, the pattern string has to be r'(\w+)\s+\1'. Well, this is not too bad, but suppose if we have a much more complex pattern, probably only the author can understand it. This is a very common issue with regex.
