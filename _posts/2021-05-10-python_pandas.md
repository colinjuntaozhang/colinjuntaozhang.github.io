The User Guide covers all of pandas by topic area. Each of the subsections introduces a topic (such as “working with missing data”), and discusses how pandas approaches the problem, with many examples throughout.

Users brand-new to pandas should start with 10 minutes to pandas.

For a high level summary of the pandas fundamentals, see Intro to data structures and Essential basic functionality.

What is Python Pandas?
Pandas is used for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning. Python pandas is well suited for different kinds of data, such as:
- Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns
- Ordered and unordered time series data
- Arbitrary matrix data with row & column labels
- Unlabelled data
- Any other form of observational or statistical data sets

How to install Pandas?
To install Python Pandas, go to your command line/ terminal and type “pip install pandas” or else, if you have anaconda installed in your system, just type in “conda install pandas”. Once the installation is completed, go to your IDE (Jupyter, PyCharm etc.) and simply import it by typing: “import pandas as pd”
