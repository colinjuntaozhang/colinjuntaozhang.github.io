Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets

Developing dashboards is no small task. You have to think about a vast amount of technical details and at the same time build something easy and enjoyable to use. Let’s say you have those areas covered. The question remains — which technology should you use? R or Python?
Today we’ll compare two technologies for building web applications — Python’s Dash and R’s Shiny. After reading this article, you’ll know how these two compare and when it’s better to use one over the other. You’ll also see if it’s worth it to make a long-term switch to either.

Library overview
Let’s start with Python’s Dash. It is a Python framework used for building web applications. It’s written in Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, so it’s an ideal candidate for creating dashboards. If you’re a heavy Python user, Dash will allow you to express your analysis quickly and visually.

On the other hand, R Shiny is an open-source package for building web applications with R. It provides a robust web framework for developing any sort of apps, not only dashboards.
Shiny is easy and intuitive to use, as you’ll see in the examples below. It also doesn’t require any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge — but this is helpful if you want extra customizability.
