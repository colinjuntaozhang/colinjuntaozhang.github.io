R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.

If you have ever wanted to analyze data and add a new toolkit to your skillset that is used by professional data scientists, then read on.
Rather than presenting a dry list of commands, this tutorial will use a specific case study as a motivating example to teach you everything you need to know about ggplot2, the de facto standard for creating high-quality graphics in R. It is a third-party library supported by the tidyverse ecosystem. While you could plot in R using the base library, you will most likely end up using ggplot2 for any actual project. Therefore, I highly recommend that you can get straight into using this library for plotting.

If you are used to Python, you may be less familiar with the grammar of the graphics paradigm that provides a more systematic way of visually presenting data. This is akin to grammar in a language where we form sentences by combining nouns, verbs, articles, etc. using certain rules. I therefore still encourage you to read through and understand this new paradigm. You will never look at graphics the same way again.
ggplot2 is an R implementation of the grammar of the graphics paradigm. Its equivalent is available in Python with a somewhat lesser-known library, plotnine.
