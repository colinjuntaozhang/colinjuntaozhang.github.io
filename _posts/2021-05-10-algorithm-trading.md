Algorithmic trading (also called automated trading, black-box trading, or algo-trading) uses a computer program that follows a defined set of instructions (an algorithm) to place a trade. The trade, in theory, can generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human trader.

Algorithmic trading is an extremely competitive and rewarding business. However, there are also risks associated in trading and it is in a constant state of evolution. In the above case, there are two core sections: 1) predictive modeling, 2) performance testing.
Relevant features are crucial for the accuracy score of predictive model. Here we had used some internal features to illustrate; however, there are external features from alternate data sources e.g. temperature, storage, other stock prices etc. may have correlation and causation with natural gas stock prices which can be looked into. Before deploying the model, rigorous performance testing is crucial. Many common issues with live trading strategies, such as not behaving or performing according to expectations are quite frequent and common in such use cases. Therefore, continuing research and performance tuning are equally critical in this evolving nature of analytical trading business.
